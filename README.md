# Worlds!
A planetary sandbox game
## About
One day I came with an idea to create a game, with fully interactive environment. I'm also keen on sci-fi genre, so I decided to put everything into space with planets and vacuum.
The world will be infinite i.e. there will be new celestial bodies farther away. Each planet will have it's own, unique ecosystem. The player will influance the ecosystem by creating pollutions, destroying or building terrain, or by making terraformation. The laws of physics will be sustained in a real but more softer, friendly way.
The goal is to survive in a changing environment, to develop, build, research and explore!

This is my personal project, I work on it on my own. I can't say when it will be finished since this is my hobby work, developed at free time.
